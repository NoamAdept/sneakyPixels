# **SneakPixel** - *Hack the Pixels, Hide Your Secrets*

**“Information wants to be free. And so do your secrets.”**

Welcome to **SneakPixel**, where **digital espionage** meets **steganography**. Hide your messages inside images, just like the best hackers of the 90s. Encrypt your world, decode the unknown.

## **🚨 Features:**
- **Encode Messages**: Insert your secret into an image. No one will know unless they have the key.
- **Decode Messages**: Upload an image, and if it contains a hidden message, **SneakPixel** will reveal it.
- **Session Security**: Use a system-generated session key or bring your own custom cryptographic key.
- **Private and Secure**: Encrypt messages and images with the key only you control.

## **🖥️ How It Works**

1. **Encoding**: Upload an image and a secret message. The system hides the message inside the image using cryptography. You can use a session-generated key or your own custom key.
   
2. **Decoding**: Upload an image with a hidden message. If you’ve got the key, **SneakPixel** will reveal the secret.
